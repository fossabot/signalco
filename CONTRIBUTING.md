## Localization

You can contribute and help us localize the app.

We are investigating how to simplify localization, but for now you can contribute by creating a Pull-Request with changes. App localizations are located in `locales` directory of this repository. You can review existing localizations or create a new one by copying one of existing localizations and populate it with data.
